### **Kubernetes Over OpenStack: Strategy, Use Case, and Example**  

**Kubernetes Over OpenStack** is a cloud-native strategy where **Kubernetes (K8s)** is deployed on top of **OpenStack** to provide container orchestration within a private cloud environment. This approach combines OpenStack’s **virtualized infrastructure** with Kubernetes' **scalability and automation**.  

### **Strategy for Kubernetes Over OpenStack Deployment**  

1. **Provisioning Kubernetes on OpenStack**  
   - OpenStack provides **virtual machines, networking, and storage** as the infrastructure layer.  
   - Kubernetes is deployed on OpenStack instances using tools like **Kubeadm, Kubespray, or OpenStack Magnum**.  

2. **Containerized Workloads on OpenStack Resources**  
   - Kubernetes manages containerized applications while OpenStack handles VM-based workloads.  
   - Ideal for organizations transitioning from traditional VMs to container-based applications.  

3. **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployments**  
   - Kubernetes clusters can be **spread across multiple OpenStack regions** or **integrated with public clouds** (AWS, GCP).  
   - OpenStack Cinder (storage), Neutron (networking), and Octavia (load balancing) enhance Kubernetes operations.  

### **Use Case: Telecommunications & Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)**  

A **telecom provider** wants to modernize its **network infrastructure**:  
- Uses **OpenStack** for managing VM-based legacy applications and networking functions.  
- Deploys **Kubernetes on top** to run **containerized network functions (CNFs)** and scale **5G services** dynamically.  
- Benefits from **resource optimization, rapid scaling, and reduced operational costs**.  

### **Example: Nokia’s Kubernetes-on-OpenStack Deployment**  

**Nokia**, a leading telecom company, deploys **Kubernetes on OpenStack** for its **5G Core Network**:  
- **OpenStack provides the infrastructure** for running virtualized network functions (VNFs).  
- **Kubernetes orchestrates cloud-native workloads**, improving agility and scalability.  
- **Result**: Faster deployment of telecom services and improved **network automation**.  

### **Conclusion**  
**Kubernetes Over OpenStack** is an optimal solution for enterprises needing **cloud-native orchestration** while maintaining **private cloud control**, making it ideal for **telecom, enterprise IT, and hybrid cloud environments**.
