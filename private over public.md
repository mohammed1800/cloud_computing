### **Private Cloud Over Public Cloud: Strategy, Use Case, and Example**  

**Private Cloud Over Public Cloud** is a hybrid cloud strategy where a private cloud environment is deployed on top of a public cloud infrastructure. This approach leverages the scalability and global reach of public cloud providers while maintaining the security and control of a private cloud.  

### **Strategy for Private Cloud Over Public Cloud Deployment**  

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Model**  
   - A **private cloud environment** is created within a public cloud using a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**.  
   - Resources are isolated using private networking, ensuring security and compliance.  

2. **Private Cloud Management Layer**  
   - The private cloud (e.g., OpenStack) runs on top of the public cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).  
   - Provides centralized control, governance, and security while utilizing public cloud resources.  

3. **Hybrid Cloud Integration**  
   - The private cloud connects with on-premises or other cloud environments, allowing seamless **workload migration and resource scaling**.  
   - Useful for **bursting workloads** where private resources scale into the public cloud when needed.  

### **Use Case: Enterprise IT Infrastructure Expansion**  

A **large enterprise** needs to expand its IT infrastructure **without investing in new physical data centers**.  
- Deploys a **private cloud environment** (e.g., VMware or OpenStack) on **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**.  
- Uses **public cloud compute and storage** while enforcing strict security policies within the private cloud.  
- Ensures **data privacy, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency** while benefiting from public cloud scalability.  

### **Example: OpenStack on AWS (Private Over Public)**  

Many companies deploy **OpenStack on AWS** to create a **self-managed private cloud** using AWS infrastructure:  
- **Compute:** OpenStack runs on AWS EC2 instances, offering full control over virtual machines.  
- **Networking:** AWS VPC isolates OpenStack networking, ensuring security and compliance.  
- **Storage:** OpenStack manages storage on top of AWS S3, EBS, or other services.  
- **Use Case:** Ideal for enterprises needing **OpenStack APIs, self-managed cloud environments, and hybrid cloud capabilities** while leveraging AWS's infrastructure.  

### **Conclusion**  
Deploying a **private cloud over a public cloud** provides the **best of both worlds**â€”the security and control of a private cloud, with the elasticity and cost-efficiency of a public cloud.
