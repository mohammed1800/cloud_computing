### **Public Cloud Over Public Cloud: Strategy, Use Case, and Example**  

**Public Cloud Over Public Cloud** is a **multi-cloud strategy** where one public cloud environment is layered over another. This approach enhances **redundancy, cost optimization, and resilience** by leveraging multiple public cloud providers.  

### **Strategy for Public Cloud Over Public Cloud Deployment**  

1. **Multi-Cloud Orchestration**  
   - Workloads are distributed across multiple public cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).  
   - Kubernetes, Terraform, or cloud management platforms manage resource allocation.  

2. **Primary-Backup Cloud Model**  
   - One public cloud provider hosts the primary infrastructure.  
   - Another public cloud acts as a backup for disaster recovery and failover.  

3. **Cloud Bursting for Scalability**  
   - A primary public cloud handles normal workloads.  
   - During peak demand, additional resources are provisioned from a secondary cloud.  

### **Use Case: Global SaaS Application Deployment**  

A **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company** needs a **highly available** and **globally distributed** infrastructure.  
- Deploys its primary services on **AWS** for reliability and performance.  
- Uses **Google Cloud** for disaster recovery and compliance with regional data regulations.  
- Ensures seamless failover and cost optimization by utilizing multiple clouds.  

### **Example: Netflixâ€™s Multi-Cloud Strategy (AWS + Google Cloud)**  

Netflix primarily runs on **AWS**, but also leverages **Google Cloud** for analytics and disaster recovery.  
- **AWS**: Hosts streaming services and user data.  
- **Google Cloud**: Processes big data and machine learning workloads.  
- **Benefit**: Avoids vendor lock-in and ensures global service continuity.  

### **Conclusion**  
**Public Cloud Over Public Cloud** provides **redundancy, high availability, and vendor flexibility**, making it a key strategy for enterprises requiring **multi-cloud resilience and scalability**.
